# Jumper
Play one of the most entertaining puzzles! The jumper is a guessing game that starts with a hidden word and a full jumper figure. You need to try to guess one letter of this word at a time. If the letter is not in the word, the jumper will lose a line. Whenever you find a letter in the word, then the jumper remains the same. Here is the goal: you need to guess the word before you lose the jumper completely.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
