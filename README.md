# Jumper
Ready to play Hilo? These are the rules: Each card will be represented by a number (1-13). You start with 300 hundred points. A card is displayed and you need to guess if the one is higher or lower. If you guess correctly, you earn 100 points. If you guess incorrectly, you lose 75 points. Each turn you decide if you want to continue or not. Once you reach 0 points, the game is over. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
