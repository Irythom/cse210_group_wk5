# Jumper

Play one of the most entertaining puzzles! The jumper is a guessing game that starts with a hidden word and a full parachute and jumper figure. You need to guess one letter of this word at a time. If the letter is not in the word, the parachute loses part of the parachute. Whenever you find a letter in the word, then the parachute remains the same. Here is the goal: you need to guess the word before you lose the jumper's head ^-^. Good luck!
